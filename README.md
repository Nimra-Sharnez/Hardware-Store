# Hardware-Store
Nimra Sharnez, Khalid Aldawood


This is a hardware store simulation.

# Structure

There are 24 tools in a store and every day one customer comes in and takes a tool for a given amount of days.
Once those days have passed the customers then return the item. A customer can have up to 3 items in their possesion.

# Patterns 
For this, we utilized the Strategy Pattern, The Decorator Pattern, Factory Pattern.

>* We used a decorated to accessorize items for customers. 
>* We used factory to create our hardware store and also create and order our tools
>* We used strategy to have different customer types. This also was utilized for different tool types.

# Start & Settings
We used Eclipse IDE to create this and java8. 
To run, download main file onto Eclipse and run.
